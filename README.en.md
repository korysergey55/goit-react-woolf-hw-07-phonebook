Phonebook-App

Tasks

- Rebuild aplication using React Huks

- The application should consist of a form and a list of contacts. In the
  current step, implement adding the contact name and phone number and
  displaying the contact list. The application should not store contacts between
  different sessions (page refreshes).

- Each contact must be an object with name, number and id properties. To
  generate identifiers, use any appropriate package, for example nanoid.

- Add a search field that can be used to filter the list of contacts by name.

- Deny the user the ability to add contacts whose names are already in the phone
  book. When you try to perform such an action, display a warning.

- Expand the functionality of the application, allowing the user to delete
  previously saved contacts.
